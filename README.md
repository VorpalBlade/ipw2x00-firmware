# IPW2100 and IPW2200 firmware

This repo exists because the upstream websites are broken and it is no longer
possible to download this old Intel Wifi firmware.

This was extracted from [Debian](https://packages.debian.org/bookworm/firmware-ipw2x00)
specifically [the debian patch tarball](http://deb.debian.org/debian/pool/non-free/f/firmware-nonfree/firmware-nonfree_20221214-3.debian.tar.xz).

This repo provides a stable location to download these firmwares for my Arch Linux AUR package.
I would love a better solution.

Please [read the license](LICENSE) before using this firmware, it is rather silly,
but this is unfortunately not free software.
